In this project, I use crawler to get topics, text contents, and other features from public opinion website.
I tried to explore how comments count and emotional words affect the final support count after 3 months.

I found that both positive and negative comment count can be used to predict the final support count.
It is reasonale that these two factors are both driven by people who care about the topics.

While content and emotion strength cannot predict the articles would whether get enough support counts to cross the threshold or not,
The population (agree or disagree count) in the first day do a better job on it.

Also, I wants to classify these articles to different field through text contents.
With text clusturing and word cloud, we can take a glimpse of those different fields.
There are some most popular topics on the website.

I also tried to use PCA to classify topics to coarser fields.
But it does not work well, we can only find the PC4 is about traffic issues.
